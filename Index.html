        <h1>Hello
        </h1>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>Kyo Sohma (草摩 夾, Sōma Kyō, "Kyo Soma"[2]) is one of the deuteragonists of the Fruits Basket series. He is the adoptive son of Kazuma Sohma, whom he was taken in by after the death of his mother and the rejection from his biological father.

            Kyo is cursed by the spirit of the Cat, an animal who would have been part of the Chinese Zodiac had the Rat not tricked him into missing the ceremony. An irregular member of the Zodiac, not only is Kyo discriminated against, disrespected, and has a future of confinement, he also has a true form which is a grotesque and foul-smelling monster— which he turns into when his Juzu bead bracelet is removed. He has blamed all of his misfortunes on his greatest enemy, the Rat, Yuki Sohma, and has dedicated his life to defeat him.
